                <div class="blog-post-content">
                    <p>Have you ever felt a deep sense of frustration or disappointment when God doesn't seem to work in the way you expect? Oftentimes, as believers, we want God to act according to our convenience, not the other way around. But when He doesn't, it can lead us to question our entire faith.</p>
                    <p>Why did Jesus ask the Leper in Luke 5:14 to show himself to the priest, and why the paralytic in Luke 5:24 to go home? Why did Jesus ask Jairus to feed his daughter in Luke 8:55, and why was the widow’s son after risen from dead simply given to his mother in Luke 7:15 with no instructions?</p>
                    <p>Let’s investigate this topic together.</p>

                    <p>My experience in college ministry often challenges my faith, helping me to think more deeply and fall more in love with Jesus. This is one question I hear all the time from my friends: "Why does God not work in certain situations?" Some even get discouraged and distance themselves from God and His people because of issues like this. While I may not have all the definitive answers, I've found three core truths that can help us anchor our faith and draw back to Scripture when God doesn't seem to answer in the ways we expect:</p>

                    <p>From these scriptures, we clearly see that Jesus performs mighty works, but they do not look the same for everyone. He is a relational God who meets individuals in specific ways to build their personal faith, or even someone else’s faith, through His work in their lives. God, in His perfect timing, always acts in the best interest of mankind; He is not a genie who grants wishes in the same way for everyone.</p>

                    <p>Consider the diverse examples from Jesus’ ministry: With the man at the pool of Bethesda (John 5:1-9), there seems to be no direct faith requirement, yet healing occurs. In contrast, with the woman with the issue of blood (Luke 8:43-48), her public healing became a powerful testimony to the crowd and a demonstration of faith. In another instance, Jesus healed Peter's mother-in-law (Luke 4:38-39) in the quiet of a home, revealing His power in an intimate setting for a more personal healing. This shows us that God does not always meet our expectations because He often works for a bigger result in a different setting.</p>

                    <h3>1. He Is Just</h3>
                    <p>God’s justice is not a justice that the human mind can fully comprehend. His justice not only serves the purpose of righteousness but goes beyond that to restore humanity. We see this clearly in the life of King Manasseh of Judah. He became king at the age of 12 and, in stark contrast to his father King Hezekiah, Manasseh served idols and encouraged the whole nation of Judah to do the same (2 Chronicles 33:1-9). As a result, the people followed the king's lead and even sacrificed children to Baal. God, being a just God, allowed Manasseh to experience the consequences of his choices. Yet, when Manasseh repented with a genuine change of heart, God, being a God of restorative justice, restored Manasseh's life (2 Chronicles 33:10-13). This shows us that God’s justice works for a true change of heart and ultimate restoration, even if the path to that justice involves unexpected consequences or delays in our immediate desires.</p>

                    <h3>2. He Is Patient (And His Timing Is Perfect)</h3>
                    <p>God's patience often extends to His timing, which doesn't always align with our schedules that often desire immediate results. The Bible says in 2 Peter 3:8, "With the Lord a day is like a thousand years, and a thousand years are like a day." This isn't about God being slow, but God working with a divine patience that encompasses greater, unseen purposes. When we don't understand His timing, we are called to "lean not on our own understanding" (Proverbs 3:5-6), trusting that His timeline is always best, even when it feels like waiting.</p>

                    <h3>3. He Is Faithful</h3>
                    <p>God is also eternally faithful. His faithfulness is not what we might define as faithfulness; it does not grant every request exactly as we envision it, but is shown in His remaining true to His character, His promises, and His ultimate redemptive plan. Even when our expectations are not met, we can trust that God remains good, present, and committed to working all things for our ultimate good and His glory (Romans 8:28). His faithfulness provides us an assurance that He will never abandon us, and His love is constant, regardless of how He chooses to work.</p>

                    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                    <p>On this side of heaven, many of these 'why' questions will remain mysteries to us. We could either endlessly ponder them, remaining in a state of philosophy that ultimately gets nowhere, or we can choose to give Jesus a chance and start trusting in His divine plan, experiencing His power in unexpected ways.</p>
                    <p>In moments when God's actions don't align with our desires, it's easy to fall into doubt. But as we've explored, reflecting on His unchanging character provides a firm foundation. We can rest in the truth of His Justice, trust His patience and perfect timing, and lean on His unwavering Faithfulness. This enduring trust in God's will, even when it's contrary to our own expectations is what ultimately brings life and leads us into a deeper experience of His transformative power.</p>
