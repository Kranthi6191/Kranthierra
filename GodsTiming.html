                <div class="blog-content">
                    <p>Have you ever felt a deep sense of frustration or disappointment when God doesn't seem to work in the way you expect? Oftentimes, as believers, we want God to act according to our convenience, not the other way around. But when He doesn't, it can lead us to question our entire faith.</p>
                    
                    <p>Why did Jesus ask the Leper to show himself to the priest, but the paralytic to simply go home? Why did He heal Peter's mother-in-law in private, but the woman with the issue of blood in public?</p>

                    <p><strong>Let’s investigate this together.</strong></p>

                    <p>While I may not have all the definitive answers, I've found three core truths that can help us anchor our faith when God doesn't seem to answer in the ways we expect:</p>

                    <h3>1. He Is Just</h3>
                    <p>God’s justice is not a justice that the human mind can fully comprehend. We see this in the life of King Manasseh. He served idols and led Judah astray, yet when he repented, God restored him (2 Chronicles 33). This shows us that God’s justice works for a true change of heart and ultimate restoration, even if the path involves unexpected consequences.</p>

                    <h3>2. He Is Patient (And His Timing Is Perfect)</h3>
                    <p>The Bible says in 2 Peter 3:8, <em>"With the Lord a day is like a thousand years."</em> This isn't about God being slow, but God working with a divine patience. When we don't understand His timing, we are called to "lean not on our own understanding" (Proverbs 3:5-6).</p>

                    <h3>3. He Is Faithful</h3>
                    <p>God is eternally faithful. His faithfulness does not mean granting every request exactly as we envision it, but remaining true to His character. Even when our expectations are not met, we can trust that God remains good (Romans 8:28).</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        "Dear friend, on this side of heaven, many of these 'why' questions will remain mysteries to us. We can either endlessly ponder them... or we can choose to give Jesus a chance and start trusting in His divine plan."
                    </blockquote>

                    <div class="cta-box">
                        <p>In moments when God's actions don't align with our desires, rest in the truth of His Justice, trust His Patience, and lean on His unwavering Faithfulness.</p>
