                <div class="blog-content">
                    <p>You might or might not have heard the phrase, “You are what you eat.” It's a popular phrase with fitness enthusiasts. When I was 17, my bodybuilding coach used to remind me of this every single day in the fitness center. He wasn’t wrong. No matter how hard I trained, how heavy I lifted, or how many calories I burned, if I didn’t eat properly, I could never reach the shape I was aiming for. In fact, without the right nutrition, I couldn’t even train well or lift at all.</p>

                    <p>Reading the Bible is much like nutrition for a Christian. Just as food fuels our bodies, God’s Word fuels our Spirit. The more we feed on it, the stronger we grow in understanding and in spiritual maturity. That’s why I believe reading Scripture is essential for every believer. Let me share five reasons why.</p>

                    <h3>1. The Bible is the true Word of God</h3>
                    <p>Paul writes in 2 Timothy 3:16–17 (ESV): <em>“All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness, that the man of God may be complete, equipped for every good work.”</em></p>
                    <p>The phrase “breathed out by God” reminds us that Scripture is not merely human wisdom—it is the very Word of God Himself. That makes it uniquely powerful in shaping us into people who are ready for His work.</p>
                    <p>What confirms this? Both evidence and experience. Historically and archaeologically, the Bible stands unmatched. The Dead Sea Scrolls, the internal consistency of texts written over 1,500 years across three continents and in three languages, and the remarkable fulfillment of prophecy all point not to coincidence, but to divine authorship.</p>
                    <p>But beyond the evidence, the Word of God is living and personal. Before I was born again, I set out to read the Bible cover— not out of devotion, but simply to say I had done it. Yet after just a few weeks, something changed. The Scriptures came alive. My priorities shifted. Through those pages, God began to capture my heart.</p>

                    <h3>2. The Bible reveals who God is</h3>
                    <p>The more I read Scripture, the more I began to see God Himself—His patience, His kindness, His justice, and above all, His sacrificial love. Through its pages, we encounter the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.</p>
                    <p>The Bible gives answers to life’s deepest questions: “What is the purpose of my life?” “Is there more to life than this?” At the same time, it speaks into the everyday questions. The more we know God, the more we begin to understand ourselves and His creation.</p>

                    <h3>3. The Bible is always relevant</h3>
                    <p>The Bible is just as relevant today as it was when it was first written—because the God who spoke it is unchanging. Jesus said in Matthew 4:4: <em>“Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God.”</em></p>
                    <p>We live in a multicultural, multigenerational world, full of shifting values. Yet all these will eventually fade. Jesus Himself said: “Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away” (Matthew 24:35). God’s Word is timeless.</p>

                    <h3>4. The Bible helps us discern truth from lies</h3>
                    <p>I once heard an illustration: imagine being in a forest, and a bear comes to attack. Someone might say, “Just shout loudly and the bear will run away.” It might work in a rare instance, but it’s not guaranteed. Yet in life, many people assume that if someone speaks loudly or confidently, then what they’re saying must be true.</p>
                    <p>That’s why we need Scripture. Our world is filled with competing voices. In an age of Artificial Intelligence and constant misinformation, we need discernment. Daily time in the Word equips us to recognize falsehood and to live with God’s perspective.</p>

                    <h3>5. The Bible transforms us</h3>
                    <p>Paul writes in Romans 12:2: <em>“Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind...”</em> Just like training consistently produces physical results, reading Scripture daily produces spiritual transformation.</p>
                    <p>Transformation is often gradual, but it is real. Each time we read the Bible, the Spirit uses God’s Word to renew us, shape us, and make us more like Christ.</p>

                    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                    <p>God has given us everything we need to know about Him and about how to live in a way that honors Him and others. As Paul writes in Philippians 4:8–9:</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        “Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just... think about these things. What you have learned and received and heard and seen in me—practice these things, and the God of peace will be with you.”
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>Reading the Bible is not just about taking in knowledge—it’s about applying it. Just as eating food without digesting it would give us no strength, reading Scripture without living it out won’t bring transformation. The Word of God is “living and active” (Hebrews 4:12), and when we let it shape our lives, it strengthens us for every good work.</p>

                        <h4>Call to Action</h4>
                        <p>Turn devices off or put them out of reach (don’t let a sale notification, email, or text pull you away); digital alerts steal your attention, so choose paper and presence to protect your focus.</p>
                        <p><strong>Try a 7-day challenge:</strong> each morning read one short passage or one chapter (5–15 minutes), write one sentence in a notebook about what God is saying, carry a physical Bible and your notes, and bring them next Sunday when you go to church.</p>
