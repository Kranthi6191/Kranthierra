                <div class="blog-content">
                    <p>You might or might not have heard the phrase, “You are what you eat.” It's a popular phrase with fitness enthusiasts. When I was 17, my bodybuilding coach used to remind me of this every single day in the fitness center. He wasn’t wrong. No matter how hard I trained, how heavy I lifted, or how many calories I burned, if I didn’t eat properly, I could never reach the shape I was aiming for. In fact, without the right nutrition, I couldn’t even train well or lift at all.</p>

                    <p>Reading the Bible is much like nutrition for a Christian. Just as food fuels our bodies, God’s Word fuels our Spirit. The more we feed on it, the stronger we grow in understanding and in spiritual maturity. That’s why I believe reading Scripture is essential for every believer. Let me share five reasons why.</p>

                    <h3>1. The Bible is the true Word of God</h3>
                    <p>Paul writes in 2 Timothy 3:16–17 (ESV): <em>“All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness, that the man of God may be complete, equipped for every good work.”</em></p>
                    <p>The phrase “breathed out by God” reminds us that Scripture is not merely human wisdom—it is the very Word of God Himself.</p>

                    <h3>2. The Bible reveals who God is</h3>
                    <p>The more I read Scripture, the more I began to see God Himself—His patience, His kindness, His justice, and above all, His sacrificial love. Through its pages, we encounter the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. In fact, John 1:14 tells us, “The Word became flesh and dwelt among us.” Ultimately, the Bible reveals God most clearly through Jesus Christ.</p>

                    <h3>3. The Bible is always relevant</h3>
                    <p>The Bible is just as relevant today as it was when it was first written—because the God who spoke it is unchanging. Jesus said in Matthew 4:4: <em>“Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God.”</em></p>

                    <h3>4. The Bible helps us discern truth from lies</h3>
                    <p>In an age of Artificial Intelligence and constant misinformation, we need discernment. Daily time in the Word equips us to recognize falsehood and to live with God’s perspective. As 1 Thessalonians 5:21 says: <em>“Test everything; hold fast what is good.”</em></p>

                    <h3>5. The Bible transforms us</h3>
                    <p>Paul writes in Romans 12:2: <em>“Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind...”</em> Just like training consistently produces physical results, reading Scripture daily produces spiritual transformation.</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        “Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just... think about these things.” <br>— Philippians 4:8
                    </blockquote>

                        <p><strong>Try a 7-day challenge:</strong> Each morning, read one short passage or one chapter (5–15 minutes). Write one sentence in a notebook about what God is saying.</p>
