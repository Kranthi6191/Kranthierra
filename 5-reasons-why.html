          <p>You might have heard the phrase, "You are what you eat." It's a popular phrase with fitness enthusiasts. When I was 17, my bodybuilding coach used to remind me of this every single day in the fitness center. He wasn’t wrong. No matter how hard I trained, how heavy I lifted, or how many calories I burned, if I didn’t eat properly, I could never reach the shape I was aiming for. In fact, without the right nutrition, I couldn’t even train well or lift at all.</p>
          <p>Reading the Bible is much like nutrition for a Christian. Just as food fuels our bodies, God’s Word fuels our Spirit. The more we feed on it, the stronger we grow in understanding and in spiritual maturity. That’s why I believe reading Scripture is essential for every believer. Let me share five reasons why.</p>

          <h3>1. The Bible is the true Word of God</h3>
          <p>Paul writes in 2 Timothy 3:16–17 (ESV): “All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness, that the man of God may be complete, equipped for every good work.”</p>
          <p>The phrase “breathed out by God” (from the Greek <i>theopneustos</i>) reminds us that Scripture is not merely human wisdom—it is the very Word of God Himself. That makes it uniquely powerful in shaping us into people who are ready for His work.</p>
          <p>What confirms this? Both evidence and experience. Historically and archaeologically, the Bible stands unmatched. The Dead Sea Scrolls, the internal consistency of texts written over 1,500 years across three continents and in three languages, and the remarkable fulfillment of prophecy all point not to coincidence, but to divine authorship. Statistically, the odds of so many prophecies coming true by chance are about 1 in 1 quadrillion (a 1 followed by 15 zeros)—an impossible figure without God’s hand behind it.</p>
          <p>But beyond the evidence, the Word of God is living and personal. Before I was born again, I set out to read the Bible cover to cover—not out of devotion, but simply to say I had done it. Yet after just a few weeks, something changed. The Scriptures came alive. My priorities shifted: I no longer wanted to waste time on video games or even in the fitness center—I wanted to keep reading. Through those pages, God began to capture my heart, and soon my journey of faith truly began.</p>
          <p>At first, even with my Christian background, I didn’t fully believe the Bible was God’s Word. But as I read, I realized it wasn’t just ancient text—it was truth alive and active. Other philosophies I had leaned on felt shallow and empty compared to Scripture. As Paul wrote in Colossians 2:6–8, we must stay rooted in Christ, not swayed by empty philosophies or human traditions. The Word of God grounds us in truth and keeps us walking faithfully with Him.</p>

          <h3>2. The Bible reveals who God is</h3>
          <p>The more I read Scripture, the more I began to see God Himself—His patience, His kindness, His justice, and above all, His sacrificial love. Through its pages, we encounter the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. In fact, John 1:14 tells us, “The Word became flesh and dwelt among us.” Ultimately, the Bible reveals God most clearly through Jesus Christ.</p>
          <!-- (rest of article continues unchanged...) -->
          <h3>3. The Bible is always relevant</h3>
          <p>The Bible is just as relevant today as it was when it was first written—because the God who spoke it is unchanging. If He is the same yesterday, today, and forever, then His Word will always remain the same.</p>

          <h3>4. The Bible helps us discern truth from lies</h3>
          <p>I once heard an illustration: imagine being in a forest, and a bear comes to attack. Someone might say, “Just shout loudly and the bear will run away.” It might work in a rare instance, but it’s not guaranteed. Yet in life, many people assume that if someone speaks loudly or confidently, then what they’re saying must be true. But confidence does not equal truth.</p>

          <h3>5. The Bible transforms us</h3>
          <p>Paul writes in Romans 12:2: “Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that by testing you may discern what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect.”</p>

          <h3>Conclusion</h3>
          <p>God has given us everything we need to know about Him and about how to live in a way that honors Him and others...</p>
