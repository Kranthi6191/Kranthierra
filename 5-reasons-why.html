        <div class="blog-post-content">
          <p>You might or might not have heard the phrase, “You are what you eat.” It's a popular phrase with fitness enthusiasts. When I was 17, my bodybuilding coach used to remind me of this every single day in the fitness center. He wasn’t wrong. No matter how hard I trained, how heavy I lifted, or how many calories I burned, if I didn’t eat properly, I could never reach the shape I was aiming for. In fact, without the right nutrition, I couldn’t even train well or lift at all.</p>

          <p>Reading the Bible is much like nutrition for a Christian. Just as food fuels our bodies, God’s Word fuels our Spirit. The more we feed on it, the stronger we grow in understanding and in spiritual maturity. That’s why I believe reading Scripture is essential for every believer. Let me share five reasons why.</p>

          <h3>1. The Bible is the true Word of God</h3>
          <p>Paul writes in 2 Timothy 3:16–17 (ESV): “All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness, that the man of God may be complete, equipped for every good work.”</p>

          <p>The phrase “breathed out by God” (from the Greek <i>theopneustos</i>) reminds us that Scripture is not merely human wisdom—it is the very Word of God Himself. That makes it uniquely powerful in shaping us into people who are ready for His work.</p>

          <p>What confirms this? Both evidence and experience. Historically and archaeologically, the Bible stands unmatched. The Dead Sea Scrolls, the internal consistency of texts written over 1,500 years across three continents and in three languages, and the remarkable fulfillment of prophecy all point not to coincidence, but to divine authorship. Statistically, the odds of so many prophecies coming true by chance are about 1 in 1 quadrillion (a 1 followed by 15 zeros)—an impossible figure without God’s hand behind it.</p>

          <p>But beyond the evidence, the Word of God is living and personal. Before I was born again, I set out to read the Bible cover— not out of devotion, but simply to say I had done it. Yet after just a few weeks, something changed. The Scriptures came alive. My priorities shifted: I no longer wanted to waste time on video games or even in the fitness center—I wanted to keep reading. Through those pages, God began to capture my heart, and soon my journey of faith truly began.</p>

          <p>At first, even with my Christian background, I didn’t fully believe the Bible was God’s Word. But as I read, I realized it wasn’t just ancient text—it was truth alive and active. Other philosophies I had leaned on felt shallow and empty compared to Scripture. As Paul wrote in Colossians 2:6–8, we must stay rooted in Christ, not swayed by empty philosophies or human traditions. The Word of God grounds us in truth and keeps us walking faithfully with Him.</p>

          <h3>2. The Bible reveals who God is</h3>
          <p>The more I read Scripture, the more I began to see God Himself—His patience, His kindness, His justice, and above all, His sacrificial love. Through its pages, we encounter the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. In fact, John 1:14 tells us, “The Word became flesh and dwelt among us.” Ultimately, the Bible reveals God most clearly through Jesus Christ.</p>

          <p>The Bible also testifies to the ministry of the Holy Spirit—the Spirit who gives believers assurance of salvation and helps us apply God’s truth to our lives. The Bible gives answers to life’s deepest questions: “What is the purpose of my life?” “Is there more to life than this?” At the same time, it speaks into the everyday questions: “How do I love my neighbor? How can I be a faithful son, daughter, brother, or friend?”</p>

          <p>The more we know God, the more we begin to understand ourselves and His creation. Scripture teaches us not only to love Him, but also to love ourselves and others the way Christ loves us. By revealing His character, the Bible helps us discover our own purpose and shows us what it means to live a life of meaning.</p>

          <h3>3. The Bible is always relevant</h3>
          <p>The Bible is just as relevant today as it was when it was first written—because the God who spoke it is unchanging. If He is the same yesterday, today, and forever, then His Word will always remain the same.</p>

          <p>From creation to new creation, from the first earth to the renewed earth, Scripture tells the entire story of humanity. And right now, we are living in the middle of that story. The Bible is not merely a historical record for the Israelites, nor just a defense of Christ’s deity for first-century Jews or Greeks. It is God’s Word for us—today, here and now.</p>

          <p>Jesus said in Matthew 4:4: “Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God.” Just as food sustains our bodies, God’s Word sustains our souls.</p>

          <p>We live in a multicultural, multigenerational world, full of shifting values, changing laws, and even disappearing languages. Yet all these will eventually fade. Jesus Himself said: “Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away” (Matthew 24:35). God’s Word is timeless. It remains true, unshaken, and relevant for every generation, culture, and person.</p>

          <h3>4. The Bible helps us discern truth from lies</h3>
          <p>I once heard an illustration: imagine being in a forest, and a bear comes to attack. Someone might say, “Just shout loudly and the bear will run away.” It might work in a rare instance, but it’s not guaranteed. Yet in life, many people assume that if someone speaks loudly or confidently, then what they’re saying must be true. But confidence does not equal truth.</p>

          <p>That’s why we need Scripture. Our world is filled with competing voices—claims about what is true, what is good, and what is worth living for. The Bible gives us a way to test those voices against God’s eternal truth.</p>

          <p>Paul warns in Galatians 1:6–9 about false gospels. Jesus warns of false prophets. Solomon contrasts true and false success. Again and again, Scripture reminds us that deception is real—and that we need discernment.</p>

          <p>Daily time in the Word equips us to recognize falsehood and to live with God’s perspective—and that’s crucial today, in an age of Artificial Intelligence when deepfakes, autogenerated content, and constant misinformation make it harder to discern what’s true. Scripture trains our minds to test and to hold fast to what is good.</p>

          <p>As 1 Thessalonians 5:21 says: “Test everything; hold fast what is good.” The Bible not only allows us to test ideas and teachings—it even invites us to wrestle with truth, to think critically, and to seek understanding.</p>

          <p>When we anchor ourselves in Scripture, we don’t just find answers to the questions we already have. We discover truths we didn’t even know we needed—truths that guard our hearts and guide our lives.</p>

          <h3>5. The Bible transforms us</h3>
          <p>Paul writes in Romans 12:2: “Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that by testing you may discern what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect.”</p>

          <p>Just like training consistently and eating well produces physical results, reading Scripture daily produces spiritual transformation. Over time, God’s Word reshapes the way we think, the way we see the world, and the way we live.</p>

          <p>If you ask anyone who has experienced new life in Christ—whether they’ve been born again or are encountering Jesus for the first time—you’ll hear about the difference between their life before and after Him. Some external things may look the same, but internally a profound change takes place. The heart begins to shift, desires begin to realign, and the confidence of belonging to Christ takes root.</p>

          <p>Transformation is often gradual, but it is real. Each time we read the Bible, the Spirit uses God’s Word to renew us, shape us, and make us more like Christ.</p>

          <h3>Conclusion</h3>
          <p>God has given us everything we need to know about Him and about how to live in a way that honors Him and others. As Paul writes in Philippians 4:8–9:</p>

          <blockquote>
            “Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is commendable, if there is any excellence, if there is anything worthy of praise, think about these things. What you have learned and received and heard and seen in me—practice these things, and the God of peace will be with you.”
          </blockquote>

          <p>Reading the Bible is not just about taking in knowledge—it’s about applying it. Just as eating food without digesting it would give us no strength, reading Scripture without living it out won’t bring transformation. The Word of God is “living and active, sharper than any two-edged sword” (Hebrews 4:12), and when we let it shape our lives, it strengthens us for every good work.</p>

            <h4>Call to Action</h4>
            <p>Turn devices off or put them out of reach (don’t let a sale notification, email, or text pull you away); digital alerts steal your attention, so choose paper and presence to protect your focus.</p>
            <p><strong>Try a 7-day challenge:</strong> each morning read one short passage or one chapter (5–15 minutes), write one sentence in a notebook about what God is saying, carry a physical Bible and your notes, and bring them next Sunday when you go to church.</p>
