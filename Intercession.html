                    <p>Did you know your prayers make a difference? Not only in our lives, but in the lives of others and even in the world around us.</p>
                    
                    <p>A story that always comes to mind when I am talking about intercession is that D.L. Moody famously made a list and prayed for 100 people he knew; 96 of them were saved during his lifetime, and four more at his funeral.</p>
                    
                    <p>The word <strong>"intercession"</strong> in Hebrew is *pāg̱aʿ*, which literally translates to the English word “to meet.” I've also heard it defined as “petition” or “stand in the gap.” This is about approaching God on behalf of another, bridging the space between heaven and earth for a specific need or person.</p>
                    
                    <p>The first time in the biblical narrative we see Abraham interceding for Sodom (Gen 18:22). We then see David interceding for Israel (2 Sam 24:1), and the prophets of the Old Testament like Joel (Joel 2:17), Daniel (Dan 9:3), and Isaiah (Isa 64) intercede. This theme repeats throughout the Bible. Even in the New Testament, we see Paul encouraging Timothy to pray and intercede (1 Tim 2:1-2). We also read Paul stating that Jesus intercedes with the Father on our behalf (Rom 8:34, Heb 7:25). Finally, Jesus intercedes for his disciples (John 17).</p>

                    <h3>Why We Intercede</h3>
                    <p>I personally believe the primary reason for our intercession should be our deep love for others. Through that love, we pray for the well-being of other believers, or as Apostle Paul would say, "saints." As we pray for the saints, we begin to see things move, and through this, we give glory to God.</p>

                    <p><strong>Intercession: God's Invitation to Partnership</strong><br>
                    Does God need our prayers? No, not in the sense that He is lacking anything. But He delights in our intercession and desires a deeper relationship with us. God, in His great sovereignty, wants us to be involved in bringing His plans to life on earth as it is in heaven. It's a divine invitation to partner with Him in His redemptive work.</p>

                    <p><strong>Intercession: A Weapon in Spiritual Warfare</strong><br>
                    The Bible says we do not fight against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms (Ephesians 6:12). Intercession is a powerful prayer that actively confronts and defeats these powers and principalities in the cosmos. It’s how we engage in spiritual battles on our knees.</p>

                    <p><strong>Intercession: A Transformative Prayer</strong><br>
                    Intercessory prayer is not just a regular prayer; it is a transformative prayer. As we've seen in the scriptures and in the powerful story of D.L. Moody, intercession has the power to transform lives—both those we pray for and our own. It cultivates compassion, strengthens our faith, and aligns our hearts more closely with God's.</p>

                    <h3>How Does It Look in Practice?</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Keep your eyes open:</strong> If you see a natural disaster or any other troubling news, intercede.</li>
                        <li><strong>Keep your ears open:</strong> If you hear anything from a family member or a friend that needs prayer, intercede.</li>
                        <li><strong>Keep your arms open:</strong> Intercession often compels us to act. Sometimes, God moves us to offer more than just words – a hug, a meal, or practical help can make His love feel tangible and real.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <div class="cta-box">
                        <p><strong>What’s on your heart today? What is the Holy Spirit prompting you to pray for? Dear saints, this is more than a burden; it is an incredibly great privilege to intercede – a privilege that aligns us with the very heart of God.</strong></p>
