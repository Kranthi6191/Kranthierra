          <h3>The World’s Obsession with Transformation</h3>
          <p>Two major world leaders — Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin — were recently overheard in China talking about being immortal and living up to 150 years through organ transplants and cutting-edge technology, unaware that there were hot mics nearby. They were brainstorming about transforming their bodies to achieve immortality.</p>
          <p>Have you ever had thoughts like that?</p>
          <p>I remember thinking about similar ideas during my Transhumanism class in graduate school at Oswego State, where we discussed the concept of living forever in a virtual world — transferring all our data, memories, and consciousness into some kind of digital cloud where our minds would continue to exist.</p>
          <p>It’s a fascinating yet crazy thought.</p>
          <p>But we all have to realize that all of this is temporary — our technology, our physical bodies, even the ambitions of world leaders trying to make themselves immortal.</p>

          <blockquote>
            “See, humanity has always been obsessed with transformation — but we often look in the wrong direction.”
          </blockquote>

          <h3>Spiritual Transformation — God’s Way</h3>
          <p>The Bible says:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <b>“Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that by testing you may discern what is the will of God — what is good and acceptable and perfect.”</b>
            <p>— Romans 12:2</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>It’s easy to break down this verse: do not follow the ways of the world, but be transformed by renewing your mind — by learning to understand the will of God.</p>
          <p>And His will is good, acceptable, and perfect.</p>
          <p>We often grasp the first part easily, but I want to take a moment to define — biblically — what it means for God’s will to be good, acceptable, and perfect.</p>

          <h3>Be Transformed — Inside</h3>
          <p>The first step toward transformation is being transformed on the inside — in the mind and the soul.</p>
          <p>This internal transformation cannot happen if we conform to the world.</p>
          <p>The mind is a fascinating thing. It often jumps around like a monkey — wanting one thing in the moment, something else twenty minutes later, and something completely different tomorrow. Especially when we are young.</p>
          <p>We’re figuring things out, making decisions, and are easily impressionable. We try to copy others, follow trends, and in the process, begin to conform to the world.</p>
          <p>But that’s not what God wants.</p>
          <p>He lives inside every believer through the Holy Spirit — and because He dwells within us, we must be transformed from within.</p>

          <blockquote>
            <b>“As obedient children, do not be conformed to the passions of your former ignorance, but as He who called you is holy, you also be holy in all your conduct, since it is written, ‘You shall be holy, for I am holy.’”</b>
            <p>— 1 Peter 1:14–16</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>Before we knew the Lord, we lived by the desires of the flesh — did whatever we wanted, however we wanted.</p>
          <p>But now, as His children, we are called to obedience.</p>
          <p>Just as children obey their parents. Why do parents tell us not to do certain things? Because they understand what’s not good for us.</p>
          <p>We are to obey our Heavenly Father — to live holy, walk holy, and be holy, because He is holy.</p>
          <p>And all those “rules” we think are bad — they’re actually not.</p>
          <p>Who here plays sports?</p>

          <p>I play soccer.</p>
          <p>If I know where the boundaries are, where offside begins, which goalpost to aim for — I can play the sport better.</p>
          <p>But if I don’t know the rules of the game and I start kicking the ball around, happy and jolly, having fun — eventually, the referee would come and hand me a red card.</p>
          <p>We don’t want that.</p>
          <p>Because when we ignore God’s ways, we’re not just breaking rules — we’re stepping out of the blessing He designed for us.</p>
          <p>The Greek word for “transformed” — <i>metamorphousthe</i> — is the root of our English word **metamorphosis**.</p>
          <p>Believers are called to experience a complete transformation from the inside out — to understand what is good, acceptable, and perfect.</p>
          <p>And with that discernment, we begin to act in a holy manner, serving our holy God.</p>
          <p>When that happens, we start to see things differently.</p>
          <p>This change begins in the mind.</p>

          <h3>The Battle for the Mind</h3>
          <p>One of the fruits Paul mentions in Galatians 5 is **self-control** — a gift from the Spirit.</p>
          <p>Now let me ask you:</p>

          <p>Can we choose to be kind?</p>

          <p>Can we choose to be generous with what we have?</p>

          <p>Can we choose to be gentle?</p>

          <p>Can we choose not to be angry?</p>

          <p>Can we choose to be unoffendable?</p>
          <p>Exactly.</p>

          <blockquote>
            “The mind, empowered by the Spirit, has the will to choose what honors God.”
          </blockquote>
          <p>That’s your pivot from theology to practical faith — it deserves weight.</p>
          <p>In contrast:</p>

          <blockquote>
            <b>“For those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who live according to the Spirit set their minds on the things of the Spirit.</b>
            <p><b>For to set the mind on the flesh is death, but to set the mind on the Spirit is life and peace. For the mind that is set on the flesh is hostile to God, for it does not submit to God’s law; indeed, it cannot.”</b></p>
            <p>— Romans 8:5–7 (ESV)</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>We must leave behind the things of the flesh and live a good and holy life.</p>
          <p>**Renewing our minds** means adopting a new way of thinking — a mind that desires to be conformed to God rather than to the world.</p>
          <p>We will never be truly transformed without this renewal of the mind.</p>

          <h3>Why We Follow the World</h3>
          <p>But what causes us to follow the world in the first place?</p>

          <ul>
            <li>We believe the world will offer us more pleasure than God will.</li>
            <li>We find a certain excitement in rushing along with the world.</li>
            <li>We fear what might happen if we truly stop and reflect on life and change.</li>
            <li>We are crippled by pride or by a negative self-image and believe there is no alternative.</li>
            <li>We reject the life of service and humility that God calls us to embrace.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>All these things must change as part of the renewal of the mind.</p>
          <p>But don’t get me wrong —</p>

          <p>You can come to Christ just as you are: broken, searching, imperfect.</p>
          <p>But once you give Him your heart, He begins the process of transforming it.</p>
          <p>He calls you to leave behind the old ways and walk in His light — becoming more like Him each day.</p>

          <h3>Be Transformed — Outside</h3>
          <p>The Christian walk is different — it doesn’t end with what happens on the inside.</p>
          <p>Sure, if I confess that Christ is Lord and repent of my sins, I receive eternal life.</p>
          <p>But if I do those two things in the morning, and then go online later that afternoon and rage-bait someone in the TikTok comments — am I really living a transformed life?</p>
          <p>That’s something worth thinking about.</p>
          <p>When we are truly transformed on the inside, it shows. People can see it.</p>
          <p>We don’t carry around the same habits, the same attitude, or the same reactions.</p>
          <p>We check ourselves, we course-correct, and we let our words and actions reflect who we now belong to — like a light set on a city hill, shining bright, where people can tell it’s not an ordinary light. It’s special, placed high for a reason.</p>

          <blockquote>
            “like a city on a hill that cannot be hidden — shining bright so others can see God’s glory through you.”
          </blockquote>
          <p>That ties back to Matthew 5:14-16 more explicitly.</p>
          <p>Transformation is not just about believing — it’s about **becoming**.</p>
          <p>In other words, this is the process of **sanctification**.</p>
          <blockquote>
            <b>“To put off your old self, which belongs to your former manner of life and is corrupt through deceitful desires,</b>
            <p><b>and to be renewed in the spirit of your minds,</b></p>
            <p><b>and to put on the new self, created after the likeness of God in true righteousness and holiness.”</b></p>
            <p>— Ephesians 4:22–24</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>This is where transformation gets practical.</p>
          <p>Paul goes on to say in later verses:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Stop lying.</li>
            <li>Stop holding grudges.</li>
            <li>Stop letting anger simmer overnight.</li>
            <li>Stop stealing.</li>
            <li>Stop using words to tear others down.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Instead — build people up.</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Be kind.</li>
            <li>Be forgiving.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Let your life become living proof that God’s Spirit is working in you.</p>

          <h3>True Character Is Seen When No One Is Watching</h3>
          <p>The real transformation isn’t just what you say you believe — it’s how you live, even when no one’s watching.</p>
          <p>Because it’s easy to act holy in front of others — in church, on social media, or in Bible study.</p>
          <p>But when you’re alone — that’s when character is revealed.</p>
          <p>If you think,</p>
          <p>“No one is watching me, I can take this,”</p>
          <p>or</p>
          <p>“No one will know it’s me — this is just a fake account,”</p>
          <p>that’s not transformation.</p>
          <p>If you say,</p>
          <p>“No one’s around, I can look at what I want,”</p>
          <p>or</p>
          <p>“It’s just a comment — I’m only rage-baiting for fun,”</p>
          <p>that’s not the life of someone renewed in Christ.</p>
          <p>My dear friends — the real transformation doesn’t fade when the lights are off.</p>
          <p>True transformation is **consistent** — inside and out.</p>
          <p>People will recognize that you are a follower of Christ not just by what you post, but by how you act, how you speak, and how you love.</p>

          <blockquote>
            <b>“By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you love one another.”</b>
            <p>— John 13:35</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>The external transformation doesn’t happen when we conform to the world —</p>

          <p>It happens when we let Christ reshape us daily, from the inside out.</p>

          <h3>Transformation Is a Choice</h3>
          <blockquote>
            “Transformation is a choice. You can stay as coal — hard and unrefined — or you can let the fire and the hands of God turn you into something beautiful.”
          </blockquote>
          <p>I’ve heard people argue that God didn’t give us free will — that everything’s already written, already decided.</p>
          <p>I remember one of my professors here at SUNY Oswego asking our class, “Who believes in free will?” Out of twenty students, it was just me and one friend who raised our hands.</p>
          <p>A lot of people think destiny is fixed, that we’re just programmed to live a certain way. But God didn’t make us like machines. He didn’t code us to give perfect responses every single time.</p>
          <p>He made us in His image — with a spirit that can think, choose, and respond. Paul says in Romans 8 that our spirit has a mind — and that means we have a choice.</p>
          <p>God won’t force transformation on you. He invites you into it. Every time you say yes, every time you surrender, every time you trust Him in the process — He shapes you a little more into His image.</p>

          <blockquote>
            <b>“Do not be deceived: God is not mocked, for whatever one sows, that will he also reap.</b>
            <p><b>For the one who sows to his own flesh will from the flesh reap corruption, but the one who sows to the Spirit will from the Spirit reap eternal life.</b></p>
            <p><b>And let us not grow weary of doing good, for in due season we will reap, if we do not give up.”</b></p>
            <p>— Galatians 6:6–9</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>So the question is simple:</p>

          <p>Do you want to stay the same, or do you want to be transformed?</p>
          <p>Because coal can stay comfortable — but diamonds are made under pressure.</p>
          <p>There is so much power in transformed minds and transformed bodies.</p>
          <p>After His resurrection, Jesus appeared to His disciples and many others over the following weeks. Seeing the risen and transformed Jesus changed everything.</p>
          <p>The same disciples who denied Him, who doubted Him, were now willing to give their lives for Him and for the truth.</p>
          <p>Paul even said, “If Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile” — showing that the resurrection proves the ultimate power of transformation.</p>
          <p>When we are transformed, we too can lead others to Christ, just like the apostles did.</p>
          <p>Transformation empowers us to point others to His Kingdom — here on Earth and ultimately in Heaven.</p>
          <p>That is our goal as believers — to spend eternity with Jesus.</p>
          <p>And it all starts in the mind, by making a conscious choice every day to pick up the cross and follow Him.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>To read the Bible when we don’t feel like it.</li>
            <li>To pray when it’s hard to pray.</li>
            <li>To be kind when kindness doesn’t come easy.</li>
            <li>To love others when we don’t feel like loving them.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Because every time we choose Him — every time we surrender our will for His — we draw closer to Him, step by step, day by day.</p>
          <p>Imagine stepping into a place where there’s no more struggle, no more striving to be perfect, no more daily battle to transform yourself.</p>
          <p>That is God’s presence — the promised Heaven Jesus prepared for us.</p>
          <p>Everything we do in our spiritual journey — renewing our minds, walking in holiness, serving others — draws us closer to Him, until one day, we are fully with Him, fully known, and fully transformed.</p>

          <blockquote>
            “And when that day comes — transformation won’t be a process anymore. It will be complete.”
          </blockquote>

          <div class="cta">
            <h4>Call to Action</h4>
            <p>The mind needs to be transformed.</p>

            <p>The actions need to be transformed.</p>
            <p>And all of this is a choice — a daily decision to reflect Christ in everything we think, say, and do.</p>

            <p>Let your transformation point to Jesus.</p>
            <p>Be Kingdom-minded — not just fixated on eternity, but living Heaven’s reality here on earth, every single day —</p>

            <p>or in other words, on earth as it is in heaven.</p>
