                    🙋‍♂️ Hi, I’m Kranthi Kumar Erra — but people call me Kranthi or if you don't know how 
                    to say my name? you can call me bro. I’m a believer in Christ Jesus, musician,
                    pastor and home chef originally from Hyderabad, India, now living in
                    the Oswego, New York. I created this space—kranthierra.com—as a place to
                    share the things that stir my soul: faith, music, words, and a good plate of food.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each part of this website will show the journey God has taken me on. Whether I’m
                    writing about faith, arranging a song of worship, or posting a recipe that reminds
                    me of home, it all flows from one place: a deep desire to glorify God and bless
                    others.
                </p>

                <h3>✝️ Rooted in Faith</h3>
                <p>
                    Romans 8:1 reminds me every day of the freedom we have in Christ:
                    "Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus."
                </p>
                <p>
                    I believe God gives each of us unique gifts—not for our own spotlight,
                    but to serve others and reflect His light in a world that’s often searching for truth in the dark.

                <h3>🎵 Where My Passions Meet Purpose</h3>
                <p>
                    Music has been part of my life for as long as I can remember. when I first started
                    to learn and play in 2012, my teacher said, if you learn from you promise me 
                    that you'll not play for silly purposes but only for Christ, I did not in the beginnning, 
                    but now I do. I will also be arranging music sheets here.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Writing helps me process and pray. Through blogs, I share life
                    lessons, scriptural reflections, and encouragement from personal experiences.
                    It’s like having a nice cup of chai(it's not chai-tea) with a good friend but in digital form.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Cooking is where creativity meets comfort. Some of the best conversations I’ve had
                    have been around the dinner table. I share favorite recipes here—simple, soulful
                    dishes that connect me to my roots and bring people together.

                <p>

                    you, teaches you, or even just makes you smile.
