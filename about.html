                    🙋‍♂️ Hi, I’m Kranthi Kumar Erra — but friends just call me Kranthi. I’m a believer,
                    musician, storyteller, and home chef originally from Hyderabad, India, now living in
                    the heart of Oswego, New York. I created this space—kranthierra.com—as a place to
                    share the things that stir my soul: faith, music, words, and a good plate of food.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each part of this site reflects the journey God has taken me on. Whether I’m
                    writing about grace, arranging a song of worship, or posting a recipe that reminds
                    me of home, it all flows from one place: a deep desire to glorify God and bless
                    others.
                </p>

                <h3>✝️ Rooted in Faith</h3>
                <p>
                    Romans 8:1 reminds me every day of the freedom we have in Christ:
                    "Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus."
                </p>
                <p>
                    That truth shapes everything I create. I believe God gives each of us unique
                    gifts—not for our own spotlight, but to serve others and reflect His light in a
                    world that’s often searching in the dark.
                </p>

                <h3>🎵 Where My Passions Meet Purpose</h3>
                <p>
                    Music has been part of my life for as long as I can remember. I love composing
                    melodies that echo faith and joy. I also arrange and share music sheets
                    here—because worship is more powerful when we raise our voices together.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Writing helps me process, pray, and proclaim truth. Through blogs, I share life
                    lessons, scriptural reflections, and encouragement from personal experiences.
                    It’s like having a quiet cup of chai with a good friend—just in digital form.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Cooking is where creativity meets comfort. Some of the best conversations I’ve had
                    have been around the dinner table. I share favorite recipes here—simple, soulful
                    dishes that connect me to my roots and bring people together.

                <h3>🌱 Why This Site?</h3>
                <p>
                    I believe in using what we have—our time, creativity, and voice—to serve others and
                    glorify God. This site is my small way of doing that. If something here encourages
                    you, teaches you, or even just makes you smile… it’s all worth it.
